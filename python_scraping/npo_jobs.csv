COMPANY
We are an early-stage, stealth-mode, private company headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are looking for the best talent wherever it may exist (within the U.S.). Company leadership is proven and has built/sold several companies in successful exits to the biggest names in tech.

OPPORTUNITY
This is a ground floor opportunity to join and contribute early, take a major equity stake in the company as part of the core team, and keep the safety of your day job and its salary and health benefits. 

• If you want the upside of a major equity stake, you should look at this opportunity.
• If you love music, you should look at this opportunity. 
• If you love developing truly innovative  and fun products, and not just the same old crap, you should look at this opportunity.

We are looking to add one more cloud engineer and one more mobile engineer to our core team, so in exchange for 10-15 hours per week of part-time work (you can keep your day job and its salary), we can offer you an amount of equity that is twice the amount typically granted to a VP of Engineering in a venture-backed startup for full-time work. This is a serious offer, and only highly qualified and serious candidates will be considered.

REQUIREMENTS
• Proficient in developing on the AWS platform/stack
• Proficient in developing in multiple languages
• Proficient in the use of SQL 
• Able to crank out meaningful quantity of high-quality work product in limited time
• Self-motivated, self-organizing, comfortable as part of fully virtual team
• Good human being, no time for a$$holes
• Truly enjoy building cool stuff
• Interested in selling what we build for an M&A exit

On the cloud side, we are using Node.js and various AWS services including Cognito, AppSync, SQS, RDS (PostgreSQL), and S3. On the mobile side, we are using RxSwift for iOS and Android apps.

COMPENSATION
This is a part-time, side-gig position. Initially there is no salary or other cash compensation – it’s equity only. We typically transition the core team (at your option) to full-time and salaried at the Series A round. This opportunity is an excellent one for a very talented individual who has a day job to cover salary requirements, but is interested in not working for a salary for the rest of their life, wants a major equity stake, and values the chance to play a key role in building a significant company.

LOCATION
Candidate must be located in the United States.

APPLICATIONS
No recruiters please. If you are an applicant, please reply to this ad with your resume and a note explaining your interest. We will not reply to all applications, but we do appreciate your interest. We will contact you if you look like a potential match.

InnoVint is a web app for winemakers that powers many US wineries. We are looking for an excellent Front End Developer specifically well versed in Angular, Typescript, and CSS. We've been in business for 6 years, we service over 350 wineries, and are generating enough revenue to sustain the company and grow indefinitely. Revenue continues to grow every year.

We are a large remote team of 12, with folks residing in SF, Napa, Portland, New York, Winnipeg, San Diego, Washington. Our employees contribute significant work to the platform remotely, from ski cabins in Tahoe to Brooklyn apartments. You'll have the freedom to set your own hours and work wherever pleases you, although we will meet up occasionally in the Bay Area and Portland. We plan for two trips a year where the full team gets together to discuss product, brainstorm, cook, and drink really expensive wine. Don't worry if your palate is atrocious -- us engineers still struggle with it after all these years.

In terms of engineering problems, we are in a fascinating space. The domain has unique and novel problems to solve. We frequently visit beautiful wineries to understand their challenges and then help deliver tangible solutions for their operations. We are a team of friends and professionals who thoroughly enjoy what we do.

You'll be an excellent candidate if you stay up on all things Angular. Do you know what Ivy is? Are you excited about PWAs? Do you swear by Typescript? RxJS?

Your time will be spent on new feature development as well as the continued migration of our AngularJS codebase to Angular, all while working closely with our winemakers and product development team to implement the business logic that runs our web app.

You Should Have Extensive Experience And Knowledge Of:
— Angular & AngularJS.
— CSS
— SAS. 
— RESTful API Development for web applications
— Webpack
— All the other obvious ones like git that come with modern web app development.

Our tech stack:

Do we still have the courage to put our hands on our hearts and being led by what we truly desire?

Your time will be spent on new feature development as well as the continued migration of our AngularJS codebase to Angular, all while working closely with our winemakers and product development team to implement the business logic that runs our web app.

You Should Have Extensive Experience And Knowledge Of:
